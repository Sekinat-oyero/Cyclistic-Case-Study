# Cyclistic-Case-Study

### Aim
The goal of this project is to help Cyclistic design marketing strategies that can help convert casual riders to annual members. The objectives include:
Demystifying how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently
Looking into why a Casual member would buy Cyclistic annual membership 
How to use digital media to influence casual riders to become members
At the end of this project, marketing strategies designed to convert more casual riders to annual members will increase Cyclistic profit because annual members are much more profitable.


### Dataset
This is a public Bikeshare dataset made available by Motivate International inc under this licence with all personal information that could lead to a breach of privacy agreement masked out. The Bikeshare dataset consists of zipped files of the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data available on this webpage. This dataset is from a reliable and known source. Also, it is comprehensive and contains current and continually updated records with a cited source. Therefore, this dataset is good and unbiased for this task. Due to the large size of this dataset,  I housed it in Google Cloud storage after cleaning and manipulation using MS Excel and Python.
I used SQL to query and analyse it on Bigquery.
